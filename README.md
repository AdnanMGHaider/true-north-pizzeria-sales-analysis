## Executive Summary

Across one year of operations, True North Pizzeria generated approximately **CAD 818K** in revenue from **21K** orders and **49K** pizzas sold. Customers typically spend about **CAD 38** per order and purchase around **2.3** pizzas per transaction, with order volume peaking on **Fridays** and remaining high on **Thursdays** and **Saturdays**, while **Sunday** experiences the lowest demand. Monthly trends show clear spikes in **July** and **January**.

**Classic** pizzas are the strongest performing category, and **Large** pizzas drive the highest share of revenue, indicating a clear customer preference for larger, classic style options. At the individual product level, pizzas such as **The Thai Chicken Pizza** and **The Classic Deluxe Pizza** consistently appear among the top sellers, while items like **The Brie Carre Pizza** underperform across revenue, quantity, and order counts.

These patterns highlight an opportunity to double down on high performing categories and sizes while reevaluating weaker items to improve overall menu efficiency and profitability.
